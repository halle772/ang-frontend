# MyAngularApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.7.

Sure, here's a simple HR web application built with Angular for the front-end and Node.js for the backend. We'll use MongoDB as the database to store employee information.

## Frontend (Angular)

1. **Sign Up and Sign In Feature**: We'll implement user authentication using Angular's built-in mechanisms or libraries like Angular Fire for Firebase authentication.

2. **Employee Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete employee records. Each record will include fields for employee name, salary, and deductions.

3. **Pay Calculation**: Based on the entered salary and deductions, the application will calculate the net pay for each employee. This calculation will be performed on the frontend for simplicity, but in a real-world scenario, it would be more secure to perform this calculation on the backend.

4. **Responsive Design**: The application will be designed with a mobile-first approach using Angular Material for UI components. This ensures that the application looks and works well on mobile devices as well as desktops.

## Backend (Node.js)

1. **REST API**: We'll create RESTful API endpoints using Node.js and Express to handle CRUD operations for employee records.

2. **Database Integration**: MongoDB will be used to store employee data. Mongoose will be used as an ODM (Object Document Mapper) to interact with MongoDB from Node.js.

3. **Authentication Middleware**: Implement middleware to authenticate requests from the frontend using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This ensures that only authenticated users can access the employee management features.

## Demonstration

Once the application is built, it will be deployed to a hosting service like Heroku. During the demonstration, I'll showcase the signup and signin process, adding/editing/deleting employee records, and the pay calculation feature. Additionally, I'll demonstrate how the application adjusts its layout and functionality seamlessly across different devices, earning bonus points for responsiveness.

## Coding and Logic Explanation

During the demonstration, I'll explain the following:

- Angular components and services responsible for handling user interactions and communicating with the backend.
- Node.js routes and controllers for processing requests and interacting with the database.
- MongoDB schema design for storing employee information.
- Authentication mechanism using JWT.
- Pay calculation logic and its implementation on the frontend.
- Responsive design techniques used to ensure optimal user experience on various devices.

This explanation will give a comprehensive understanding of the application's architecture, coding practices, and the logic behind its features.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
